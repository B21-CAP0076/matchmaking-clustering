## How to run it?
There are two ways to run this notebook. By using **Google Colab** or run it on **Local**.

### Google Colab (Recommended)
1. Open Google Colab in research.google.com/colaboratory/
2. Access Github Tab
3. Search B21-CAP0076
4. Choose B21-CAP0076/matchmaking-clustering as repository and master as branch to create new notebook
5. Download data files in this repository (final_encoded_dataset.csv)
6. Upload that file to the Colab environment by accessing Files Menu on the left navigation bar
7. Click Run All in Runtime Tab
8. Now, you can wait for the notebook to finish its jobs! Happy Hacking!

### Local
1. Install Anaconda in your Local (docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)
2. Open Anaconda Navigator application
3. Run CMD.exe Prompt from Anaconda Navigator
4. Create and activate environment by running this script in CMD.exe Prompt (without "-")
```
- conda create -n habitech-mm-clustering python=3.7
- conda activate habitech-mm-clustering
```
5. Download required files from this repository and put in the same folder
```
- Habitech_Clustering_for_Match_Making_Feature.ipynb
- final_encoded_dataset.csv
- requirements.txt
```
6. Move your CMD.exe Prompt directory to the directory where those four files existed
7. Install requirements by running this script in CMD.exe Prompt (without "-")
```
- pip install -r requirements.txt
```
8. Install and run Jupyter Notebook by running this script in CMD.exe Prompt (without "-")
```
- conda install jupyter
- jupyter notebook  
```
9. Open Habitech_Clustering_for_Match_Making_Feature.ipynb
10. Now, you can run this notebook through Jupyter Notebook! Happy Hacking!
